> A remote access trojan (RAT) is malware that controls a system via a network connection as if by physical access. While desktop sharing and remote administration have many legal uses, RAT is usually associated with criminal or malicious activity. RAT is typically installed without the victim's knowledge, often as payload of a Trojan horse, and will try to hide its operation from the victim and from security software. **- Wikipedia**
